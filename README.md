# MassBeat
## A workout and trainer consultation app

refers to the transitional period of the covid 19 pandemic, where people realized the importance of living a healthy life so they started doing various sports activities and nutritious food to achieve a healthy lifestyle. 

However, due to the lack of public knowledge of how to exercise properly and correctly and the lack of gyms due to the pandemic, we are trying to help the community about a healthy way of life by providing good and correct sports program services and access to fitness consultations with trainers, so that this project was built as workout application and trainer consultation "MassBeat".

### Projects

This project was built using the design thinking method by finding out the problems and needs of the community and then providing ideas as solutions to existing problems.

In the early stages, this project will be built in web form using the React JS framework and styling using Tailwind CSS.
